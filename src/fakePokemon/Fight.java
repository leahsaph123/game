		/*
		 * pushing to git was so frustrating!!!!
		 * idek what i did but it worked
		 * first i used team > commit > commit and push in order to push BUT
		 * it pushed to master instead of main
		 * so i had to put them together
		 * i deleted the master branch and then used terminal commands
		 * git push origin main --> pushes to main
		 * git fetch origin --> pulles from main
		 * it worked but idk if ill be able to do it again without taking an hour
		 * 
		 * i also used a personal authentication token when i was using the commit and push option in place of typing in my password
		 * prob have to generate a new one each time i want to push because i can't look at it again
		 * WHEN YOU GENERATE THE TOKEN, MAKE SURE TO GIVE IT ALL PERMISSIONS!!!!!
